# React-Native-Patch CLI
This CLI helps in removing the friction involved in configuring the metro bundler port, currently hard coded to __8081__ in react-native-cli, which may be blocked/in-use for some reasons on your machine.


Though there are options available to overcome this for e.g react-native-port-patcher, but still require extra effort as a developer.

## Pre-requisites
    Requires React Native CLI to be installed.
    (npm install -g react-native-cli)

## Install
    npm install -g react-native-patch

## Alias
You can use an alias for the react-native-patch command as __rnp__ :tada:.

    rnp init AwesomeProject -p 9099

## Sample Usage
    rnp init AwesomeProject -p 9099

## Typscript Support
If you want to generate/create the project using typescript as the language then pass -t as an option.

    rnp init AwesomeProject -p 9099 -t
## Patch
If you already have a project and just want to patch the metro bundler port number use:

    rnp patch -o 8081 -n 9000
Remember -o defaults __8081__ if not provided. To run this command make sure you are at the root of your react native project.

[@ktonon](https://github.com/ktonon) for writing react-native-port-patcher. 

I shamelessly copied the logic to replace the hard coded port with the new one.

## Limitations
    Only tested on Mac.
